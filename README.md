## About

With love and respect to Kinetic Games. <3

This is a WIP fan-made project to play Phasmophobia with my mates. We've loved everything about the game's experience, but we found the in-game journal to be cumbersome. I built this tool to help keep track of our evidence until the end game cleanup.

Built with a mobile-first user experience in mind as I do not have a second monitor on my gaming computer. Instead, I use my iPhone while playing.

## Incoming Features

- Evidence labels
- More verbose ghost details in description
- Footer instructions
- More color scheme options for night gaming
- Better code organization
- Unit tests for my own practice
